&lt;p&gt;So I wanted to make a FPS, well to be more specific I&amp;rsquo;ve been teaching myself the basics of 3D rendering and programming. So I wanted to do really start putting something to screen so I took a side step to create this very very simple completely 2D ascii based first person controlling uh&amp;hellip;thing. I already knew a bit of C++ prior to this but getting to use features like vectors (which are like dynamic arrays where data is entered at the end if I understand what I&amp;rsquo;m doing), it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty interesting learning experience, much of it was asking for help.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Been a while since I made a blog post, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d write about what I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning as a of late. I&amp;rsquo;ve made strides in C++, I&amp;rsquo;m a bit more comfortable with pointers, as always stated the best way to learn is to throw yourself in the deep end and learn to swim. I&amp;rsquo;ve reversed engineered simple C++ projects to made use of pointers, breaking it until I figured out how things worked, and from there I&amp;rsquo;ve made a really small project that uses C++, the project itself is unconventional as I also wanted use vectors because I&amp;rsquo;m relearning math (I vomited). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other goals I have are learning Rust because I find it to be pretty interesting as a language and how it&amp;rsquo;s positioning itself, alongside this I&amp;rsquo;ve also dabbled with React Native and Flutter. At one point in my budding career I made an iPhone app with Swift 2, and I surprisingly still remember a lot about iPhone development&amp;ndash;one day I really want to take on the absolutely monstrous task of updating the app from Swift2 to current&amp;ndash;and so I wanted to compare the various avenues available to iPhone app creation. Flutter is interesting in how everything is in a stack (pretty sure they don&amp;rsquo;t call it stack though) I like it but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to reason about your code as you it gets longer and longer, I really love Dart as a programming language though and would love to see it get more life but that&amp;rsquo;s up to the will of the community. React Native is familiar to me because well&amp;hellip;I know React so moving over to React Native wasn&amp;rsquo;t too much of a struggle. Despite the fact I mostly work with Javascript/HTML/CSS, and that I am constantly working with React, I still don&amp;rsquo;t feel I&amp;rsquo;m great at it (it being React), slightly frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things I&amp;rsquo;ve been dabbling in are graphics programming, specifically OpenGL and DirectX, at the moment I&amp;rsquo;ve been mostly learning the fundamentals, drawing a pixel on screen, projection matrix/orthogonal matrix. I&amp;rsquo;m making sure not to spread myself thin so I don&amp;rsquo;t get burned out, but I&amp;rsquo;m definitely enjoying learning about these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graphics programming is very low priority and it&amp;rsquo;s what I do to &amp;ldquo;reward&amp;rdquo; myself for data structures and algorithm studies. I still don&amp;rsquo;t know them all by memory but I have a very solid understand on why they exist, why some are better in some situations over others. I had always known big O notation though I&amp;rsquo;m not sure from where so that definitely helped in learning these things, but it truly changes your perspective on developing good programming practices. On this subject one area I still need to focus on problem solving and specifically problem solving challenges that many websites have like hackerrank, etc. I find myself not dedicating time to this and that&amp;rsquo;s something I plan to change.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Chattn is &lt;a href="https://chattn.netlify.com"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say the best way to learn something is to throw yourself into the deep end. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really have any grand idea for a project app, so I did what any other developer would do&amp;hellip;just recreate an existing product. Twitter is always a good goal, I created a very basic twitter clone with React/Redux but never hosted it but decided I would do so with this one. I chose to create this with Vue because I was always interested in it but never got around to giving it a spin as I usually stuck with React. I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and try something new. Vue clicked fairly quickly which is in large part to understanding React and having general knowledge of Javascript and reactive UI frameworks and paradigms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted this unlike my React/Redux version of Twitter to go past surface level features of simply posting and displaying said posts, that&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple and tired and everyone is doing it. So I decided to add do more adding feature by feature. So I added features that I liked from Twitter and really thought about implementation, with this project I really wanted to focus on the backedn which in this case was Google&amp;rsquo;s firestore, well I originally went with Firebase, but wanted to try Firestore mostly because it was in my face on the Google dashboard &amp;ldquo;Try our next gen real time database Firestore!&amp;rdquo; Firestore follows many of the same paradigms as other NoSQLs so getting up and running was pretty easy, doubly so because of Google&amp;rsquo;s great documentation, and its similarities with its brother Firebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking on Vue, this is a fantastic little framework and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I enjoy working on it more than React. It feels like it sits right between React and Angular as far as layers and components (see what I did there?) that are included in it. I really appreciate you can slowly implement Vue into a project whereas React is an all in affair. I haven&amp;rsquo;t really messed with Angular much so I won&amp;rsquo;t comment on it in any meaningful capacity. I will say that Vuex is much easier to reason about than Redux but I will also fully admit that it might because I &amp;ldquo;know&amp;rdquo; Redux so any other flavor of the flux architecture just clicks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I previously stated, I learned Vue/Vuex as I worked on this project so looking through branches it becomes very apparent that I learn something new and implement it, on this project I didn&amp;rsquo;t create tests, which I full admit is my shortcoming as a developer and need to be much more dilligent on writing them before I start coding, there are no downsides to running tests, so always write them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="neat" src="https://i.imgur.com/oV08wIf.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the features I&amp;rsquo;m most proud of are base64 image implementation so that I could have image previews before the user posts, I rewrote the image upload feature a few times. In the initial version, the user would select their image and it would upload to Google storage immediately after selecting it, leaving the user without the ability to cancel or change what image they used with their post. That was my naive implementation and it took me several days to come up with the base64 version. Admitted despite knowing of Base64, it took a while for it to occur to me to utilize it. Because of how I initially assumed twitter image posting worked I couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of a better way to do everything. The next thing I want to tackle is better handling of the moment the image is loading after a user hits post. I am not a fan of that second or two of waiting for the image to laod. There are several methods to fix this, the easiest and most straightforward is using Google Functions to resize/quality reduce the image so it loads quicker. This is the approach I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on but it&amp;rsquo;s proving to be frustrating as when a post is created, the image is sent to the Google storage and a permanent link is generated and that link is appended to the post&amp;rsquo;s imageURL field, THEN Google function kicks in and does imageMagicks on it but it does not generate a permanent link for the newly created image&amp;hellip;so I cannot appened it to the imageURL field. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other idea for tackling this is to get the dimensions of the user&amp;rsquo;s image and creating a placeholder container that is of the supplied dimensions then let the actual image take its place once the image has loaded, I thought of this approach due to wanting to better implement lazy loading where I wanted to use the same idea of using the image&amp;rsquo;s dimensions to create a temporary container (as well as taking the user image&amp;rsquo;s dominant colors to color the container)
&lt;img alt="Oop" src="https://i.imgur.com/c7nk5r9.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another feature I was proud of was more backend related but I spent a week agonizing on how to trigger images being deleted from the storage bucket when a user deleted their post, and was getting frustrated with being on the cusp of figuring it out but having to wait to test my firestore functions as they needed to be uploaded to the function module on Firebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I definitely shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have done was that I did all the CSS from scratch instead of using a library like Bulma or my new favorite, Tailwind. In hindsight this was both a good thing and a terrible mistake, it was a good thing because I really had to think of implementation and I learned how Vue handles CSS interactivity. The cons were&amp;hellip;I was basically doing everything from scratch, so everything you see and are interacting with was all me no help from libraries or baked in functions from a CSS framework. I tried to stick with the BEM methodology to the best of my abilities but I also wanted to mess with the various ways Vue handled CSS so it was getting harder, that and I would do naive implemenetation to figure out if I&amp;rsquo;m going in the right direction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my biggest challenges I overcame was finally truly breaking my SQL mindset when working with NoSQL and embracing repeat data. What finally made it click for me was looking at data usage on database dashboard and realized I was making multiple requests for user data, and honestly even before that it just made no sense how often I was requesting data for simple things. A great example would be the bookmark feature I just recently added. They are stored as a subcollection based on the users&amp;rsquo; collection documents. The necessary information from each bookmark post is stored in this collection which in this case are: username, user id, profile picture, post image if there is one. This data is already present in the database but if I didn&amp;rsquo;t duplicate it I would have to query it from that particular user&amp;rsquo;s post collection. You can see how inefficient this becomes if the user were to have say 60 bookmarks, the database would have to query the all 60 users&amp;rsquo; post collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still more features I want to add and I have an idea on how to go about them. I need to implement better display of notifications, right now it&amp;rsquo;s just plain text in green but this is just a toy project and I don&amp;rsquo;t want feature creep to set in and suddenly I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on it for months upon months (which technically I already have, I started this in like April or May&amp;hellip;). I&amp;rsquo;ve added some neat features so far and really need to refactor many others, but before I add anymore I need to add tests to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Features I haved added so far are: Likes, posting, comments, image upload, profile creation and updating, profile photo and profile banner, bookmarks, authentication. At the very least I want to add in the ability to make an account private because it seems like a nice challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly I have yet to add follower/following not because I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to or anything of the sort, I created a decent implementation using PostgreSQL back when I made Drubbble. I definitely understand the underlying of how to implement it with a NoSQL, so implementation isn&amp;rsquo;t the reason. Honestly the reason is simply because&amp;hellip;it would introduce a bunch of feature creep haha, because I can&amp;rsquo;t stop at simply following/followers, I&amp;rsquo;d want to add the ability to block, having block automatically unfollow an account, and a few things which I imagine would mean I&amp;rsquo;m yet spending another couple months on the project on the minimum side. With that stated&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;m probably still gonna add it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Iâve been working nearly exclusively with NoSQL databases because theyâre a lot different than traditional SQL databases, and how you approach them feels very foreign to me to an uncomfortable degree. One of the things that Iâm still wrapping my head around is associations and the fact that you donât always necessarily make a new âtableâ for them. To give a more concrete example, Iâm working on a Dribbble clone,  In a traditional SQL database I would approach creating the user table as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user table itself would consist of email, password for one table and the second table would be the âprofileâ table which would consist of the more personal information such as: location, twitter handle, background photo, profile photo, website, list of skills. A profile table &lt;code&gt;belongs to&lt;/code&gt; a user, and a user &lt;code&gt;has one&lt;/code&gt; profile (that is dependent on the user, thus if the user deletes her/his account the profile goes with it). With NoSQL databases, itâs not necessary to create another table to handle this association and can be embedded within the user document without much worry. Embedding the profile is the best approach for the profile because the profile is definite in the number of objects in it (create a separate document if you expect the size of said document to grow example being: storing user all a userâs comments).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Itâs definitely taken some time to really wrap my head around this, and even on this Iâve found myself questioning âdo I need to even embedâ I find myself asking this due to the added complexity that comes with embedding and trying to both populate and query against embedded data. If you take a my commits for (Chirpper)[https://github.com/diope/chirpper) youâll see I go back and forth between embedding the profile and keeping it on the same depth as the rest of the user document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Itâs an interesting challenge working with NoSQL, in some ways it feels familiar to SQL databases (mostly in how you query data, itâs quite similar to most SQL ORMs), unfortunately I miss the power that comes with knowing SQL and being able to use that to be more nuanced (and performance minded) if necessary. I do not look forward to learning normalization techniques for NoSQL DB given how long itâs taken me to really get used to SQL databases techniques. That and I still find myself thinking of everything as SQL associations and joins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly I prefer SQL databases (postgreSQL is bae!) but I do appreciate a few things about NoSQLs mostly the fact I can edit data much quicker, no migrations needed, you can even directly edit documents on the fly which in some cases makes troubleshooting easier.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Grab the app &lt;a href="https://github.com/Diope/miniNotes/releases/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (hosted on Github)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mininotes is a very small appilication I created because I wanted a simple note taking app that lived in the menubar. This is my first time using React with Electron and it&amp;rsquo;s been a challenge getitng it to work, but with the power of documentation and stackoverflow, as you can see I over came. Prior to creating this, I was using evernote&amp;rsquo;s app which was a lot of app just to use one small portion (and I had to make an account among other things, le sigh). I&amp;rsquo;ll be adding more to the application, mostly setting a global keybinding to invoke the app when it&amp;rsquo;s not the focus, and menu icon highlight when active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ooooh awww" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3039981/46878777-1d3bed80-ce12-11e8-9e1b-5a0d8a8a8f22.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote about creating it &lt;a href="http://www.dipet.me/blog/electron"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the app!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I created another app for macOS mininote (available: &lt;a href="https://github.com/Diope/miniNotes/releases"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), the reason I created this is simple&amp;hellip;I have a convoluted process for making small notes or pasting them from my clipboard and it involves alfred -&amp;gt; textedit.app -&amp;gt; cmd+p or jotting down my note. Or sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ll open up the note app. But honestly I really got tired of doing that, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to keep either of them in my dock if only purely for aesthetics (I am chuckling as I write this). So I decided why not make a small scratchpad app that will live in my menu bar. I did some surface level searching for one, and came across evernote&amp;rsquo;s application but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want all the other crap it came with. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t trying to organize, sort, and archive my notes. I literally just wanted something I could quickly cmd+v something into or jot down random note and then go about my day until I needed it again. I figured, why not build it, how hard could it be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t really hard, but it was involved. First question what language I was going to write this in. I actually early on thought about doing it with Swift (and honestly might do a rewrite), but then I thought what if I want to distribute it on Windows because I run into the same issue there despite the fact that nowadays I only use my Windows machine to play games on Steam/Uplay/Origin. I&amp;rsquo;ve created two tiny apps with C# and .NET but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to create one version of my app on macOS in Swift then another for windows in C#, that&amp;rsquo;s way too much work for my small app. So that left the only logical choice, Javascript and using Electron. There was also Java but&amp;hellip;no. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, Java as a language is cool I guess, but yea no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a few issues with Electron, mostly memory management. After learning C/C++, the various *allocs, pointers and referencing (not saying I&amp;rsquo;m a pro but I understand now). I&amp;rsquo;ve grown a great appreciation for performant, efficient code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am familiar with Electron as I&amp;rsquo;ve made an app with it previously called &lt;a href="https://github.com/Diope/Readr/releases"&gt;Reader&lt;/a&gt;, despite how it looks, it was pretty simple when you break it down. The hardest parts were related to interaction because I only used CSS/HTML for that instead of a UI framework like React or Vue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this project I decided I would use React, I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with it and feel confident enough that I can get something simple like mininotes to play nice. I will go into detail in another post on all of the things I did, this post serves mostly to write what I learned creating this app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing I learned: Ejecting&amp;hellip;still no reason to it at all! React build is still going to be your friend as it allows you to update as React receives updates. Another thing I learned&amp;hellip;sometimes documentation isn&amp;rsquo;t the most clear from the examples given. I didn&amp;rsquo;t git commit them but I assure I spent a good week or two slamming my head against my machine trying to figure out why I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get menu icons to show up using Electron-Builder but everything worked with Electron-Packager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding a React Markdown component was fairly simple, I started with React-Ace but I was searching for a way to do inline text manipulation without needing a second screen and it seemed like I had to jump through hoops to get React-Ace to do the basics of that, though I did like the various languages it would parse, if the need for more arised. So I kept looking until I stumbled upon React-SimpleMDE. It allowed same window editing but had editor icons associated with it. That was no problem, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d just hack them out (which I proceeded to do until seeing the option to remove it lol). Did the neessary React setup (creating an handleChange&amp;hellip;handler and setting the text to the user passed value). Even though I&amp;rsquo;m decent with React, I quite often find myself forgetting some of the basics and needing to consult other projects I&amp;rsquo;ve done to remind myself (es un poco molesto). Once I got that working, I was essentially done as I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to pass the data back to electron as React was responsible for the UI (this will also make persistence straightfoward later, if I choose to implement it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here I spent time styling the app (admittedly it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a whole bunch to style but still I I needed it to look nice), most of my time was spent on logo and menu icon design more than anything, I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to set the world on fire and win awards so I kept it simple, only doing three sketches before I opened Sketch and went to work. Now that I had that out of the way, it was time to package the app. Sidenote: I settled on 32x32 for the @2x menu icon size, and 16x16 for the @1x, in case anyone is reading this and wants to know the dimensions. I tried larger (44x44) but it looked entirely too big and had no padding so it sat at the edge of the top and bottom of the menubar, and it just looked hilariously out of place next to my other menubar apps&amp;rsquo; icons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to package this sucker, I initially decided on using Electron-Packager for this figuring that Electron-Builder was for more complex applications (I am not sure WHY I thought this), something I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise until this app was that Electron-Packager with it&amp;rsquo;s default settings just shoves the entire project folder as it is into your .dmg file, which is like holy shit why?! As a result of this, my app was over 700mb in size&amp;hellip;yea that was unacceptable, I was determined to get Electron-Builder to work, Electron apps are already huge because they require chrominium instance to run and that&amp;rsquo;s 40MB by itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where I messed up with Electron-Builder: The &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; section of &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;; looking at various examples online, I thought the only thing I needed was my &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; directory that is produced by yarn/react build command. But this isn&amp;rsquo;t actually correct, I pretty much forgot that build will only produce code related to React (I know I know how did I forget this lol) so for a good 4 days, I sat in frustration wondering why things weren&amp;rsquo;t working when I packaged the app but worked fine when I ran &lt;code&gt;electron .&lt;/code&gt;. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to do any of this with Readr because again it was CSS/HTML in the sense of not using a UI framework that utilized webpack or Rollup.js, or anything. Just a couple of files contained within the same folder (note to self, go back and separate things into different folders honestly). So once the lightbulb went out that reminded me I needed to include my electron folder (for two of those days, I honestly thought it was the way I was naming my folder containing my electron code ð). So I had to tell Electron-Builder the folders it needs, which looks like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"build"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"files"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"build/**/* (this is the react build folder and all it's sub-folders)"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"electron/**/*"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;electron&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;folders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;",

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ran Electron-builder and&amp;hellip;nope, so close! An error slightly unrelated to my project, I got a node error regarding fsevents, which was not resolved by npm installing it, well fuck so what do I do? Well apparently I could get around it by simply running the same command via yarn&amp;hellip;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand exacly why that I but honestly I didn&amp;rsquo;t research into it too much, this was supposed to be a weekend project that ended up becoming a two week project smh. 
(Note: the project was longer than the github log suggests, I duplicated the folder later and setup a new git).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the build is now working? No, apparently Electron-builder could not find &lt;code&gt;main.js&lt;/code&gt; despite the fact I specified it in my &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;, some internet searching told me to add &lt;code&gt;homepage:&amp;#39;./&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt; to my package.json file, alright. So I tried that&amp;hellip;and no dice. Hmm, well that addtion does make sense, as it would tell Electron what the entry point is for the app but yet it produces nothing. So some more digging on the interwebs taught me about Electron-Builder&amp;rsquo;s metadata option, which basically let&amp;rsquo;s you inject a file during the build project. After conflicting information on the correct syntax to use, which was &lt;code&gt;-c.extraMetadata.main=electron/main.js&lt;/code&gt; (in my case the main.js was located in the electron folder). Again I emphasis that &lt;code&gt;electron/main.js&lt;/code&gt; is specified as the starting point, which is fine for Electron itself (running &lt;code&gt;electron .&lt;/code&gt; produces no issues), but apparently means nothing to Electron-Builder? Anyways, that option fixes it. But I the npm fsevents issue popped back up. So I created a script called &lt;code&gt;electron-pack&lt;/code&gt; to build the app using the aforementioned flag and much like last time it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, so everything builds and actually runs! Yatta, but one final issue stood in my way, Mojave came out and I introduced a dark mode. So now I had to figure out how to account for people using the dark mode menu bar, scheiÃe! I sat for about an hour searching through Electron documentation for API hooks for Mojave&amp;rsquo;s dark mode. I figured it&amp;rsquo;d be a pretty simple if statement, dark mode ? dark menubar icon : light menubar icon. I ended up finding out it was even more simple than that! Because I&amp;rsquo;ve always used dark mode (and prior a dark menu bar) I created the mininote icon in white&amp;hellip;which is wrong. All I had to do was create the icon in #000 black, and make sure the file name ended with &lt;code&gt;Template.png&lt;/code&gt; ex: &lt;code&gt;trayIconTemplate.png&lt;/code&gt;, and macOS takes care of making it white when used with dark mode, or leaving the icon as it&amp;rsquo;s default black when used in light mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s the basic run down of the creation of this app, or rather some of the random hangups I had while creating it.&lt;/p&gt;
